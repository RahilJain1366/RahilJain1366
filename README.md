- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RahilJain1366
- A graduate student in Computer Engineering at UT Dallas with a strong interest in Quantum Computing, Machine Learning, and Embedded AI. I work on projects involving Quantum Reinforcement Learning, QAOA, deep learning for precision agriculture, and motion anomaly detection using edge devices. My experience spans developing intelligent agents, working with CNNs and Binarized Neural Networks. Iâ€™ve also developed APIs for banking systems, delivered talks on AI and RL, and built assistive tech like audio-based navigation for the visually impaired. Iâ€™m always excited to explore new ideas at the intersection of AI, quantum tech, and real-world applications.
